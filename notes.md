# Notes: 

"We at Loom are using Truffle to build, test, and deploy our smart contracts. To make our life easier, we developed something called a provider that lets Truffle deploy to Loom PlasmaChain just like it deploys to Ethereum.

Without delving too much into details, the provider works like a bridge that makes Web3.js calls compatible with Loom PlasmaChain."
